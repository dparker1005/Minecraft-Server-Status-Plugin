=== Minecraft Server Status ===
Contributors: David Parker
Version: 1.1.1

——— Description ———
This plugin will display information about a Mincraft server
using an API call to https://mcapi.ca/query/play.minesuperior.com/info.

Information includes whether the server is online, the number of players
online, the maximum allowed number of players on the server, the ping,
and the version of Minecraft that the server is running.

This plugin can be used to look at multiple servers at the same time. You
can also exclude information that you do not want to see from calling
the shortcode using the admin panel.


——— INSTRUCTIONS ———
Information can be displayed on a Wordpress website by using the
shortcode [mc_server_status server=“INSERT_SERVER_HERE”]. You can 
disable undesired output by going to “Minecraft Server” in the admin
panel, un-checking any undesired information, and clicking “Update”.
